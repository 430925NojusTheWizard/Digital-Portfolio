## Design one
<img src="src/img/Storyboard.png" height= 1000px>

## Design two
<img src="src/img/Storyboard2.png" height= 800px>

# Decision
I decided to keep the first design as it looks more modern and professional as well as not as compact as the second one which might overwhelm the employer/person of interest
